### Hello! I'm Jacques✨

**About Me:** 🏳️‍🌈
I'm a baking, rock climbing and D&D playing Unity game developer. I'm a student at UCSC studying Games & Playable Media (Msc) 🐌 

My pinned repos are some of my best work, you'll find them all with README's explaining the project & the work I contributed to them. See my games in action on YouTube or Itch!
